Description: Ada TUI for managing rclone cloud mounts with rate limiting
 Cloud Sync Tuner provides an interactive terminal interface for
 configuring rclone cloud mounts with optimal rate limiting settings.
 It generates systemd service files with appropriate VFS cache modes
 to prevent API rate limiting from cloud providers like Dropbox.
 .
 Features include:
  - TUI for cache mode selection (off, minimal, writes, full)
  - Rate limiting configuration optimized per provider
  - Smart sync with bandwidth scheduling
  - SELinux policy for enterprise security
  - Desktop integration (Nautilus, Dolphin)
  - System tray daemon with notifications
