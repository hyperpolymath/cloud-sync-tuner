== Platform Roadmap

=== Tier 1 (Full Support)

* Linux (amd64, arm64) - libfuse3, kernel WireGuard
* macOS (amd64, arm64) - macFUSE, Network.framework

=== Tier 2 (Partial Support)

* FreeBSD - fusefs, if_wg kernel module
* Windows - Remote ops only (no FUSE)

=== Tier 3 (Best Effort)

* Linux (i386, RISC-V) - Limited testing
* Minix - libcurl fallback, no FUSE
* Android - Remote ops only

=== Not Planned

* iOS - No FUSE support, App Store restrictions
* Proprietary RTOS - No kernel module support
